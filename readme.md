# Code Standards

This repository contains a set of code standards and guidelines, along with a few helpful resources.
These standards are part of the [@wearebase](https://github.com/wearebase) code quality assurance process.

Please note: This document is biased towards PHP and JavaScript, which are the most common languages we currently use. Much of it should apply to other languages (such as Objective-C, Java, Python and Ruby) however if an existing industry standard is in widespread use then it should be preferred. Wherever possible we try to follow industry standards.

## Files and formatting

* Save files as UTF-8
* UNIX-style line endings. (`git` should take care of this for you if you use Windows)
* Indent using 4 spaces. This is the standard for PHP. Your editor can make this seamless for you.
* Lowercase filenames, without any punctuation apart from `-` and `.` (except where this contradicts with another standard)


## Comments

* Comment what is not obvious


## Source control (eg `git`)

* Large changes to whitespace should be in their own commit
* Where possible try to name online repositories in the format "[Client name] - [Language / type] - [Project name]"
   * E.g. Base - Android Library - User API
   * The reason for including the language is to avoid conflict of projects due to the vast array of languages that may be used on a single project


## Passwords

* Use industry best practices for storing passwords safely. We currently use [bcrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) to store user passwords in databases.
* User login forms should be protected against remote brute force attacks.
* Passwords must be "strong", meaning they have an [entropy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength#Random_passwords) of at least 56 bits. This is approximately equal to a password with 12 lowercase characters or a password with 9 mixed-case alphanumeric characters.


## Security

* Industry best practices should be followed for security
* Never trust any type of user data
* Remove services such as FTP, which transfer data unencrypted, and instead use secure services such as SFTP.
* Private SSH keys should have pass-phrases


## PHP

* PHP code must have no syntax errors (check with `php -l filename.php`)
* Use [PSR-0](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md) or the frameworkâ€™s class autoloader when loading classes
* Follow [PSR-1](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md) to the letter with all new code and when updating legacy code
* Follow [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md), except when working with legacy files
* Naming conventions should follow http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design and http://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/conventions.html#method-names
* Don't mix PHP with HTML


## SQL

* Use [parameterized queries](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/60174/how-to-prevent-sql-injection-in-php) whenever possible


## JavaScript

* See [this file](javascript.md).


## SCSS

* Follow scss-lint's guidelines, use a [scss-lint in Sublime](https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/SublimeLinter-contrib-scss-lint)
* Write CSS in [BEM](http://www.joelambert.co.uk/article/bem-guidelines/) style unless there's a good reason not to
* CSS should be object-oriented
* Formatting
   * 2 spaces, not tabs
   * A space to the left of `{` and a newline after
   * Rules on new lines, with a space after `:`
   * `}` on its own
   * Single line per selector
   * Where possible, order rules in alphabetical order.
   * Always place prefixed rules above non-prefixed rules.
   * Comma seperated rules go on a new line
* Guidelines
   * Keep to hex codes rather than text, ie `#000` not `black`
   * Keep to shorter hex codes where possible, ie `#000` not `#000000`
   * Use `0` not `0px` and not `none`
* Avoid going [more than 4 levels deep in nesting](http://thesassway.com/beginner/the-inception-rule)
* Sass comments (`//`) instead of CSS comments (`/* ... */`)
* Prefer class selectors (`.`) and avoid id selectors (`#`)
* Comment where styles are used if it is not obvious
* CSS hacks should be avoided and documented if they are ever used (use [conditional classes on the html element](http://paulirish.com/2008/conditional-stylesheets-vs-css-hacks-answer-neither/) instead)


## HTML

* `.class-name-with-dash__child-item`
* If needing a class to access with js, prefix with `.js-`
* `#ids-lowercase-with-dashes`
* HTML5 doctype: `<!doctype html>`
* HTML should be valid
* Lazyload images with noscript fallback

## Performance

* Compress images and other assets for the web
* Follow [YSlow rules](http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html)
* Follow [Google Page speed rules](https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/best-practices/rules_intro)

# Servers

## Web servers

* The web server (eg Nginx or Apache) should serve the project document root from `/var/www/project-name`.
* This path MUST be 1 of:
  * where the project actually lives (if project root == web root and it's basic upload / git deploy, without releases)
  * a symlink to the web root outside of `/var/www`, eg `/home/app-user/project-name/current/web`
